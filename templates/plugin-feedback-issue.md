# Plugin Feedback GitHub Issue Template

Template for creating GitHub issues on the ACIS repository for plugin-wide improvements discovered during Process Auditor execution.

## Issue Creation Command

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo "aivantage-consulting/claude-plugin-acis" \
  --title "{ISSUE_TITLE}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
{ISSUE_BODY}
EOF
)" \
  --label "process-auditor,{RECOMMENDATION_TYPE},{PRIORITY}"
```

## Issue Title Format

```
[Process Auditor] {TYPE}: {SHORT_TITLE}
```

Where `{TYPE}` is one of:
- `Correction` - Something needs to change
- `Enhancement` - New capability or improvement
- `Deprecation` - Something should be removed

Examples:
- `[Process Auditor] Correction: Deferral heuristic missing parallelizability factor`
- `[Process Auditor] Enhancement: Add framing language patterns to extraction`
- `[Process Auditor] Correction: Remove severity threshold from goal extraction`

## Labels

Standard labels for Process Auditor issues:

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `process-auditor` | Always (identifies source) |
| `correction` | Type is correction |
| `enhancement` | Type is skill_candidate or reinforcement that suggests new feature |
| `deprecation` | Type is deprecation |
| `critical` | Priority is critical |
| `high-priority` | Priority is high |
| `extraction` | Affects `/acis extract` |
| `deferral` | Affects deferral logic |
| `parallel` | Affects parallel execution |
| `discovery` | Affects discovery phase |
| `quality-gate` | Affects quality gate |

## Example: Extraction Severity Threshold Issue

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo "aivantage-consulting/claude-plugin-acis" \
  --title "[Process Auditor] Correction: Remove severity threshold from goal extraction" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Source

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Audit ID** | AUDIT-20260205-PR60-EXTRACTION |
| **Project** | CareAICompanion |
| **Date** | 2026-02-05T23:45:00Z |
| **Recommendation ID** | REC-PR60-0002 |
| **ACIS Version** | 2.7.0 |

## Problem Statement

Low/medium severity items are excluded from goal extraction, causing 60% of actionable issues to be missed.

## Evidence

**Observed in Goals**: PR60-G5, PR60-G6, PR60-G7, PR60-G8, PR60-G9, PR60-G10

**Impact**: User had to manually identify and add 6 goals that should have been auto-extracted.

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

| Level | Why | Answer |
|-------|-----|--------|
| WHY-1 | Why were G5-G10 not extracted? | Categorized as low/medium severity |
| WHY-2 | Why did severity affect extraction? | Extraction prioritized high severity only |
| WHY-3 | Why was there a severity filter? | Assumed low-severity items are optional |
| WHY-4 | Why was this assumption made? | Optimized for actionability over comprehensiveness |
| **WHY-5 (ROOT)** | Root cause? | **Extraction severity threshold is miscalibrated** |

## Proposed Fix

Remove severity threshold from extraction. Extract ALL quantifiable issues. Use severity for prioritization, not inclusion.

### Affected Components

- `commands/extract.md` - Extraction logic
- `templates/extraction-patterns.md` - Pattern definitions

### Code Change (if applicable)

```javascript
// BEFORE
if (severity === 'critical' || severity === 'high') {
  extractGoal(issue);
}

// AFTER
extractGoal(issue); // Extract ALL, sort by severity for prioritization
```

### Effort Estimate

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Effort | small |
| Breaking Change | No |
| Priority | high |

## Generalizability Assessment

| Criterion | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Scope | Plugin-wide |
| Generalizability | high |
| Projects Affected | All projects using /acis extract |

## Integration with Process Auditor

The Process Auditor (`/acis audit`) uses this template when:
1. A recommendation has `applicability.scope === "plugin"`
2. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is available and authenticated
3. User has write access to the ACIS repository

If any condition fails, falls back to local feedback file.
